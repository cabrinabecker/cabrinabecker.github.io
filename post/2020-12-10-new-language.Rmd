![This is me and one of my best friends, Richa, who is also in this class, and we are working on the project together. I'm going to use her in my example of how to use Python, since we learned it together.](/post/2020-12-10-new-language_files/smallroach.jpg)

We learned assign values in values to variables, and then use those to run functions, such as multiplication and division.

```{python}
trois = 3.0

cinq = 5

print(cinq*trois)

print(trois/cinq)
```

Using reticulate, we can use R and Python to talk to each other.

```{r}
library(reticulate)

richa <- "da homie"
```

Using r., we can access the R-defined objects:
```{python}
richa="main chica"

print(r.richa,richa)

```

Using py$, we can access Python-defined objects
```{r}
cat(c(richa,py$richa))
```
