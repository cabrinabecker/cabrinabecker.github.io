      <description>Data Wrangling and Data Exploration Introduction These datasets were taken from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) website, and contain data from medical schools in 2019. &amp;quot;appsandmats&amp;quot; is a dataset that contains information about U.S. medical school applications and matriculants by school, state of legal residence, and sex, 2019-2020. &amp;quot;raceeth&amp;quot; contains information about the total enrollment by U.S. medical school and race/ethnicity for the 2019-2020 year. These are interesting to me because I am in the process of interviewing for medical schools in Texas only, and it is cool to see data from schools that I have interviewed for but also around the US.</description>
